📘 Overview

This project involved designing and implementing a complete SQL-based database system for an educational institution. It includes schema creation, data population, and complex data retrieval to support real academic workflows such as course assignments, enrollments, student management, and instructor mapping.

🧱 1. Database Schema Design (Normalization Included)

Developed a structured relational schema with five core entities:
	•	Departments
	•	Students
	•	Instructors
	•	Courses
	•	Enrollments

Each table was designed with primary keys, foreign keys, and referential integrity constraints, ensuring a normalized structure suitable for scalable academic management.

📝 2. Data Insertion (Realistic Institutional Dataset)

Populated the database with rich sample data, including:
	•	10 departments
	•	10 instructors
	•	10 courses
	•	10 students
	•	15 enrollments

The dataset covers diverse academic departments, realistic instructor assignments, and multi-course student enrollments.

🛠️ 3. Data Manipulation & SQL Queries

Performed multiple SQL operations to extract actionable insights.

✔ Update Operations

For example, updating emails and department assignments for a student (Task 3-1, page 1)
￼

✔ Multi-table JOIN Queries

Fetched instructor details teaching a specific course such as Database Systems (Task 3-2)
￼

✔ Aggregation & Grouping

Calculated:
	•	Students per department
	•	Course count per instructor
	•	Average grades per course
	•	Total enrollments per course

For example, the output table on page 3 shows student distribution across departments.
￼

✔ Schema Alteration

Added a new Grade column to extend the Enrollments table (Task 3)

📊 4. Analytical Outputs

The SQL results visualize institutional behavior:
	•	Computer Science has the highest student count (page 3 output).
	•	Instructors like Dr. Anjali Menon teach multiple courses.
	•	Course enrollments range from 1–3 per subject (page 6 chart).
